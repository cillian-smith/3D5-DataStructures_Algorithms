# 3D5-DataStructures_Algorithms
Repository for assignments from 3D5 Data Structures and Algorithms module. 

## Assignment 1: 
### *Hash tables and linked lists*
Involved Parsing a CSV and storing the data using hash tables and linked lists 

## Assignment 2 
### *Creating, sorting and comparing arrays and sorting algorithms*
Simple sorting alorithms and comparing them 

## Assignment 3 
### *Binary Search trees*
Craete two Binary search trees - the first to store data and the second to store the name and wordcount of books and ensure the tree was balanced and ensure it was efficent

## Assignment 4 
### *Searching with graphs*
Searching graphs using DFS and BFS to traverse an unweighted graph, then using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path through a weighted graph and finally using Dijkstra to find the shortest path between bus stops in Ireland using an undirected, weighted graph.
